Nagraaj emerges from a misty jungle, his serpents hissing around him. Dhruva flips down from a tall city tower, landing beside him with precision. Parmanu descends from the sky in a glowing arc of energy. The three heroes exchange nods, then sprint forward in unison as the camera pans around them in slow motion, capturing swirling dust, sparks, and glowing effects against a twilight skyline.

3d style In a richly detailed 3D cityscape blending futuristic tech with ancient Indian motifs, Nagraaj rises from a swirl of green energy, serpents coiling around his armor. Dhruva leaps down from a digital billboard, landing in slow-motion with glowing batons drawn. From above, Parmanu dives through a crackling energy portal, his suit radiating atomic pulses. The camera circles them in bullet-time as they strike heroic poses, then launch into synchronized action â€” serpents lashing, batons flying, atomic blasts lighting up the dusk. The scene freezes mid-action like a comic panel brought to life in stunning 3D.
